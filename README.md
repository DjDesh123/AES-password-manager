# AES Password Manager

This project is a password manager that uses AES encryption to securely store and manage your passwords. This application is designed to ensure that sensitive data is protected by strong encryption while also providing a simple and easy-to-use UI created with Python (Flask) for managing said passwords.

## Current Status

This project is still under development. Therefore, the following has been implemented:

- A login page has been created, providing the frontend interface for users to log in.
- The JavaScript functionality for interacting with the backend is still in progress.
- AES encryption and other core functionalities are yet to be implemented.

## Current Features

- **Login Page**: A clean and simple login interface to allow users to enter their credentials (functionality coming soon).

## Technology Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (in progress)
- **AES Encryption**: Python (PyCryptodome)
